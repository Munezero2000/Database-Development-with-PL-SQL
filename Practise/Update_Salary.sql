/*Write a PL/SQL program that prompts for an employee's code and checks whether an employee's salary 
is greater than the average of all the employee’s salaries. If the salary is greater than the average, the 
program should raise a bonus_not_allowed exception. Otherwise, the program should print the message 
'The bonus will be added'. Make sure that the program handles all possible exceptions.*/
