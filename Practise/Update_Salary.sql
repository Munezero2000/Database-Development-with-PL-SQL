/*Write a PL/SQL program that prompts for an employee's code and checks whether an employee's salary 
is greater than the average of all the employeeâ€™s salaries. If the salary is greater than the average, the 
program should raise a bonus_not_allowed exception. Otherwise, the program should print the message 
'The bonus will be added'. Make sure that the program handles all possible exceptions.*/
